Don\u2019t you just love to hear a great customer success, maybe told by a sales rep or through Ideas, about how \u201cyour\u201d feature is used and loved by the end users? But unfortunately we can not count on our users to continuously tell us how much they appreciate you and your work. Projectplace believes that metrics can bring us the good news\xa0continuously instead._\n_Projectplace also believes that an increased usage is a good indication that the system and a single feature/tool is perceived as useful. We need to determine what should be measured and why, and continuously follow up on the metrics to validate that the work we do lead to an increased usage of the various product areas._ \nFollow up metrics found here:\nhttps://projectplace.geckoboard.com/dashboards/9CCDC0FFF295EBB9\n\nh3. Improve RnD productivity, efficiency and quality.\n\n_To improve our productivity we need to continuously reflect on our agile processes and what to improve, change or remove. By process we mean things like continuous deployment, metrics driven development, Scrum etc._\n_We also need to make sure that we share knowledge as well as code/design between teams while being aligned with the product roadmap._\n_Communities play a significant part in improving productivity, efficiency and quality in our teams. Communities help the teams align with Projectplace Coding Guidelines and Projectplace Design Guidelines and at the same time share knowledge between our teams._\n_Why is it important to have a balance between what a cross functional autonomous teams needs what is good for the whole of Projectplace? The teams need to align and continuously communicate with the other Projectplace teams and sometimes makes trade-offs for the greater good. For example, avoiding duplication of code, or introducing practices, conventions or technology that would potentially hinder other teams._ \n_Finally, our productivity, efficiency and quality requires that we continue to attract/recruit ambitious and highly skilled people that share our values, coach them and keep the ones that fit._\n\nh3. Define and communicate the product value proposition\n\n_As you all know R&amp;amp;amp;amp;D has been tasked with the responsibility of driving the work on product strategy, product roadmap, and to define and communicate of the product\u2019s value proposition. With this new challenge as the backdrop we have started to create new roles that will work more dedicated in this area._\n_This method will be expanded for the next quarter\u2019s revision of the V2MOM._\n', 'logotype': '/cstmr-icons/000000D0-5.png', 'group_edition': None, 'cost_code': '', 'project_type': 'classic', 'owner': 30809919, 'blueant_connected': False, 'membership_role': None, 'id': 208, 'name': 'Research & Development'}, {'membership_type': 'member', 'account': 80029674, 'description': '', 'logotype': '/ppi/2009/layout/lighttheme/icons/project-icon.png', 'group_edition': None, 'cost_code': '', 'project_type': 'classic', 'owner': 1005270654, 'blueant_connected': False, 'membership_role': None, 'id': 1005278671, 'name': 'Sai Enterprise Account'}]
